# Chess Engine Strength Testing Plan

## Phase 1: UCI Protocol Implementation
**Goal**: Make your engine compatible with standard chess testing tools

### 1.1 UCI Interface Development
- Implement UCI protocol in Go using existing reference implementations
- Add UCI command handlers: `uci`, `isready`, `position`, `go`, `stop`, `quit`
- Support standard UCI options like `Hash`, `Threads`, and custom strength parameters
- Create UCI wrapper around existing engine logic in `game/engine.go`
- **Reference**: Use `github.com/freeeve/uci` and `github.com/ChizhovVadim/CounterGo` as implementation guides

## Phase 2: Testing Infrastructure Setup
**Goal**: Create automated testing environment

### 2.1 Install cutechess-cli Framework
- Set up cutechess-cli as primary testing tool
- Configure `engines.json` for engine management
- Create testing scripts for various tournament formats
- Set up concurrent testing on multiple CPU cores

### 2.2 Opponent Engine Collection
**Strong Reference Engines:**
- **Stockfish 17** (3000+ ELO) - configurable down to 1320 ELO using `UCI_LimitStrength` and `UCI_Elo`
- **Komodo** or **Leela Chess Zero** for additional reference points

**Weak/Beginner Engines:**
- **Tarrasch Toy Engine 0.905** (~1500 ELO)
- **Ufim 0.82** (configurable down to 700 ELO)
- **T.rex 1.8.5** (1200-1400 ELO range)
- **LC0 with Maia networks** (1100+ ELO)

### 2.3 Testing Environment Configuration
- Standard time controls: 10s+0.1s for rapid testing, 60s+1s for accurate ratings
- Opening book: Use standard test suites (Noomen, UHO_XXI_+090_+099.epd)
- Hardware: Document testing system specs for reproducible results

## Phase 3: Evaluation Methodology
**Goal**: Systematically measure engine strength

### 3.1 SPRT Testing Implementation
- Configure SPRT parameters: Â±10 ELO margin for development testing
- Set up automated testing pipeline with 4 concurrent games
- Implement statistical significance testing (95% confidence)
- Create progression tracking from weak to strong opponents

### 3.2 ELO Rating Ladder
**Testing Progression:**
1. **700-1000 ELO**: Test against Ufim 0.82 at lowest settings
2. **1000-1300 ELO**: Test against T.rex and weak LC0 configurations
3. **1300-1500 ELO**: Test against Tarrasch Toy and limited Stockfish
4. **1500-2000 ELO**: Test against Stockfish at 1320-2000 ELO settings
5. **2000+ ELO**: Full strength testing against top engines

### 3.3 Testing Scenarios
- **Fixed depth testing**: Limit search depth (3-7 plies) for controlled weakness
- **Time-limited testing**: Variable time per move (0.1s to 10s)
- **Skill level testing**: If implementing skill levels like Stockfish
- **Opening variety**: Test from various opening positions

## Phase 4: Automation and Documentation
**Goal**: Create reproducible testing pipeline

### 4.1 Automated Testing Scripts
- Bash scripts for tournament execution
- Python/Go scripts for results analysis and ELO calculation
- Automated opponent strength progression
- Result logging and statistical analysis

### 4.2 Results Tracking System
- Database or structured files for match results
- ELO progression tracking over development cycles
- Performance benchmarking (nodes/second, search depth)
- Comparative analysis against engine versions

### 4.3 Documentation Structure
Create comprehensive documentation with:
- **Testing Protocol**: Step-by-step testing procedures
- **Engine Specifications**: Current capabilities and limitations
- **Benchmark Results**: Performance metrics and ELO estimates
- **Improvement Tracking**: Version-to-version strength progression
- **Known Issues**: Current weaknesses and planned improvements

## Phase 5: Advanced Testing Features
**Goal**: Professional-grade evaluation capabilities

### 5.1 Distributed Testing
- Consider OpenBench integration for large-scale testing
- Multi-machine tournament execution
- Cloud-based testing infrastructure

### 5.2 Specialized Testing
- Endgame tablebase testing
- Opening book performance evaluation
- Tactical puzzle solving benchmarks
- Position-specific strength analysis

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Objective ELO Rating**: Reliable strength measurement from 700-2000+ ELO
2. **Weakness Identification**: Specific areas for improvement (tactics, endgames, openings)
3. **Development Baseline**: Reproducible testing for measuring improvements
4. **Competitive Analysis**: Understanding relative to other engines at similar development stage

## Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: UCI implementation, basic cutechess setup, Stockfish testing
2. **Medium Priority**: Weak engine testing, SPRT automation, documentation
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced testing features, distributed testing, specialized analysis

## Current Engine Status
- **Architecture**: Go-based engine with bitboard move generation
- **Search**: Minimax with configurable depth
- **Evaluation**: Basic material evaluation
- **Protocol**: Custom CLI interface (needs UCI implementation)
- **Performance**: 4M+ nodes/second in testing

## Next Steps
1. Implement UCI protocol interface
2. Set up cutechess-cli testing framework
3. Begin systematic strength evaluation against known opponents
4. Document results and iterate on engine improvements

This plan provides a comprehensive framework for professional chess engine evaluation, enabling systematic strength measurement and improvement tracking.
